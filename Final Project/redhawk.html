              In Mexico, Rehawkâ€™s coffee is grown by local farmer Pepe Arguello. The farm has been run for three generations, and his farm is called Finca Santa Cruz. He grows coffee cherries with a variety of flavor profile including (but not limited to) grape, plum, and strawberry. Pepe is committed to conservational agricultural practices, using the native flora and fauna of the area to aid in the coffee-growing process. Furthermore, he spends hundreds of hours fermenting the beans and is frequently experimenting to develop new blends.

            <p class="card-text">Ethiopia Gogogu is a farm in Guji which produced coffee with notes of stone fruits and local Ethiopian florals. This specific type of coffee is grown at a very high altitude, which gives it a unique flavor and taste. The process of harvesting the coffee beans here is rigorous; involving 2-3 says of soaking the beans before beginning an almost two-week-long drying process.

              Redhawk uses a micromill located in Columbia to produce rich, diverse coffee blends. This micromill facility comprises of 8 different local farmers who bring the coffee cherries to the mill frequently; the cherries then proceed to begin the fermentation process here, undergoing constant checks to ensure the process is timely. The drying period takes about a month and a half and, after this period, they are sent to a coffee production site which grounds them up and sends them to Redhawk.
