        <div class="card-body">
          La Prima was created by Sam Patti over 30 years ago in downtown Pittsburgh&#39;s Strip District. Initially, the store sold espresso machines but, later, pivoted to become the coffee shop that it is today. There are currently five locations, but their coffee is sold in 14 stores across the city as well. There are currently two locations at CMU: in the Gates-Hillman Center (which opened in 2021) and in Wean Hall (which opened in 2018). Currently, they source their coffee beans from several different countries around the world; explore some of them below.

              <p class="card-text"> La Prima&#39;s medium roast hails from Papua New Guinea, growing in the colder valleys where coffee plants receive rain and are grown in moist climates. This coffee is part of a local effort led by Moses Venapo to help local farmers gain access to markets and learn more about how to price their coffee. This coffee is processed in small batches, and its flavor is described as sweet with hints of vanilla and strawberry.</p>

              <p class="card-text"> Produced in the Los Santos region of Costa Rica, another of La Prima&#39;s medium roasts has notes of lemon and cherry. This coffee is grown at high altitudes in volcanic soil, eliciting complex flavors. Typically, they have a snappy flavor due and “clean” taste. </p>

              <p class="card-text"> In Brazil&#39;s Cerrado region, the coffee is produced by thousands of farmers who produce about 6 million bags of coffee every year. This particular region is known for its red, mineral-filled soil along with its heavy rains and tropical climate. This coffee at La Prima is a light roast with notes of peanut and sour apple. </p>
